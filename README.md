This research examines financial-economic crises using diverse economic indicators across
different countries. Distinguishing itself from conventional model comparisons, our study
introduces a practical element – a graphical representation illustrating how policymakers’
decisions, such as setting thresholds (τ ) and importance levels (µ), influence model outcomes.
This approach provides valuable insights for policymakers, banks, and governments, enhancing
our understanding of model performances. Notably, the thesis compares traditional and novel
methods, including the introduction of five boosting methods (Ada, GB, XGB, LGBM, CatB)
alongside standard techniques like KNN, SVM, DT, and RF.
